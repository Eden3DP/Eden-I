Q: How stupid. Why would I want a computer and a 3D printer in one!?

A: Why wouldn't you want to use the Eden I to manifest your thoughts into things in one location, on one device? We believe this helps reduce the complex workflow of designing and therefore 3D printing your creation. This was designed by us, for us. We are simply sharing it with the world and excited to recieve any feedback to make the proper improvments where necessary in upcoming versions. We're most excited for the self-hosted distributed network option to download in the coming months.  Thank you for any constructive criticism and feedback. It's greatly appreciated.
