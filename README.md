# FAQ
Q: What is the Eden3D BlueBox?
---
A: The BlueBox is a physical metal storage container for 3D printers to place users' requests inside, locked so only the requested user can open up and pick up their product. 

Q: What does the BlueBox do?
---
A: This container is simply a place for 3D printers to place a finished product inside for local pickup. This BlueBox is locked and secured through a metal latch, powered to unlock and lock by a QR code on the lid. Users picking up their product will use their phone to scan the QR code from inside the Eden3D mobile app, unlocking the BlueBox. This sends a message to the 3D printer, showing that not only the product was picked up, but the part ws paid for via scanning the QR code. Sats delivered to the 3D printer full node. 

Q: What is the purpose of the Eden3D BlueBox?
---
A: The main purpose of the Eden3D BlueBox is for the 3D printer to allow for local pickup, without being present when the user is ready to pickup. This helps in both coordination between the user and 3D printer to expedite the delivery and payment process in a secure manner. 


Q: How stupid. Why would I want to go to someones house, on their front porch and scan a QR code to pick up my product!?
---
A: Why wouldn't you want to use the Eden3D BlueBox to securing coordinate with the 3D printer you chose to help build your idea to life, without ever seeing them in person? This was designed by us, for us. We are simply sharing it with the world and excited to recieve any feedback to make the proper improvments where necessary in upcoming versions. We're most excited for the self-hosted distributed network option to download in the coming months.  Thank you for any constructive criticism and feedback. It's greatly appreciated.
